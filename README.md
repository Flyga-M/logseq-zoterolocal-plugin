3. Complete the rest of the plugin settings. For Author and Page Name templates, ensure that you only use the stated placeholders.
4. Go to any page that will hold your Zotero template and type `/Insert Zotero template`. A sample template will be generated. Make changes as per your requirements. Please ensure that if you change the template name, you need to reflect the same template name in the plugin settings.

5. Lastly, trigger `/Launch Zotero plugin` from any page you want to hold the page reference to your journal article, and click `Insert` to insert it into your graph. A new page will be created and a reference to it inserted to where you triggered the slash command.
